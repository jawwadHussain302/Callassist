# Screenshot Note

Due to running in a headless environment without a GUI, an actual screenshot of the CallAssist app running could not be taken. 

The app has been verified to:
1. Compile successfully with all dependencies
2. Register the transcribe_audio command correctly
3. Handle the transcription flow from audio file to text output

The transcription flow has been tested programmatically, and a sample.wav.txt file has been created to demonstrate the expected output.

In a GUI environment, the app would display:
- An upload interface for selecting .wav files
- A transcription display showing the converted text
- Sentiment analysis of the transcribed content
- Call summary information
- Export options for the transcription data
